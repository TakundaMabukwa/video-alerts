4 Protocol basis between video terminal and video
platform
4. 1. Basic stipulations of the agreement 
The communication method, data type, transmission rules and message composition of the 
protocol are in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 4 of JT/T 808-2011. 
The communication connection mode of the signaling data message in the protocol is in 
accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of JT/T 808-2011. 
The message processing mechanism of the signaling data message in the protocol is in 
accordance with the requirements of Chapter 6 of JT/T 808-2011. 
The encryption mechanism of the signaling data message in the protocol is in accordance with the 
requirements of Chapter 7 of JT/T 808-2011. 
In the agreement, the communication parties between the platform and the terminal shall meet 
the following requirements: 
—— Unless expressly agreed, all messages shall be responded; 
—— If the dedicated response message is not clearly specified, a general response shall be used 
to reply; 
—— For messages with sub-packages, the responder shall respond to each sub-packet message 
one by one.
4. 2. Real-time audio and video transmission channel
agreement
One channel of real-time audio and video transmission can transmit one channel of video 
information or one channel of audio information, and can also transmit one channel of video 
information and one channel of audio frequency information. There are two types of real-time 
audio and video transmission channel conventions:
——When the TCP is used, each TCP connection can carry multiple audio and video channels. If 
there is no data within the set timeout,, both the terminal and the monitoring center can actively 
close the TCP connection used for audio and video data transmission.
——When the UDP is used, each UDP port can carry multiple audio and video channels.

4. 3 Classification of audio and video communication packets 
 Audio and video data packets are divided into the following two categories: 
——Signaling data packets: the data format should comply with the provisions of JT/T 808-2011, 
and add new protocol instructions and data formats on the basis of its protocol format. The 
communication should use the established link between the vehicle video terminal and the 
enterprise video surveillance platform for transmission of positioning information, and no new 
link should be created. 
—— Bit stream data message: used for network real-time audio and video transmission, network 
video playback, voice dialogue, voice monitoring, voice broadcasting, etc. A new link should be 
created instead of the link for transmitting positioning information.
